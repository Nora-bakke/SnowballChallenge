      <h2>Our goal</h2>
      <p>The biggest cities in the world is being polluted by the large amounts of fossil fuels that the cities releases. And the air quality is counted as “unhealthy” for the inhabitants of the cities. We want to change this bad trend by making GreenWalls. GreenWalls is exactly what it sounds like, a wall that is green. The green coulure does not come from green paint, but green plants. These green plants take up CO2 and release oxygen through the photosynthesis. Every city in the world have a lot of buildings with walls that is not being “used”, often filled mud, graffiti, and other things. We want to fill this wall with green plants. We know that this alone cant save the world, but we think it is a step in the right direction.</p>
